* Mitchell Gravity Set
** Synopsis
   This library generates the Gravity Set, 
** Background
   The original MGS was implemented as a 2D gravity field.
   As well, at the time, the computing power of the computers
   at the time were limited, and generating a 3D field would've
   required a lot more time.

   Today, multicore CPUs are common, and so I've decided
   to implement this solely as 3D. We are entering new
   terrority here, as I do not know what to exepct. But
   it makes more sense anyway, since real gravity operates 
   in 3D space, in the classical Newtonian sense.
