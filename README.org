* Mitchell Gravity Set
** Synopsis
   This library generates the Gravity Set, 
** Background
*** Motivation
   The original MGS was implemented as a 2D gravity field.
   As well, at the time, the computing power of the computers
   at the time were limited, and generating a 3D field would've
   required a lot more time.

   Today, multicore CPUs are common, and so I've decided
   to implement this solely as 3D. We are entering new
   terrority here, as I do not know what to exepct. But
   it makes more sense anyway, since real gravity operates 
   in 3D space, in the classical Newtonian sense.   

   Besides, today we have very impressive 3D fractals rendered
   by others, and I am not willing to be "left out" of the
   fun! This will also be a serious chance to make use of the
   OpenGL library for rendering the results.
